The sock is particularly adapted for use in Yoga exercises, Pilate exercises, stretching and other mat-based exercises, and comprises a sock made of a natural, plastic or synthetic fiber. The sock has five toe holes in the front end with webbing extending between the toe holes from the top of the sock to the bottom or sole of the sock to provide these openings through which the toes of a user can extend. The sock also has a layer of a PVC vinyl material on the bottom or sole of the sock which has a sticky or friction characteristic to enable the sock to grip a floor or mat when used by an exerciser, with or without the use of a mat, and to allow the toes to be exposed for tack or gripping functions.

2.What is your preferred payment/delivery method? Ppl may think it’s ridiculous that some people quit buying from you just for the payment they don’t use, but it is true.

Usually, we offer different subscriptions packed with different features. But is the distinctions between plans clear to visitors?Target visitors who spend more than average on the pricing page. Ask a follow-up question: “How can we improve it?” when someone answered no.




week 7: persona/ scenario/ wireframe

‣ Use research to create an affinity map that identifies trends and
insights within the research findings.
‣ Articulate the benefits and shortcomings of personas as a design tool.
‣ Use research to create personas that reflect the target audience.





week 8: Prototyping (low fidelity and high fidelity), Usability testing (interviews with target users)

Usability Testing:
   Basically find out whether what I am building or designing is usable and good experience for the user. 
 Testing prototypes clickable
